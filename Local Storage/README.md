## 📘 Overview

The code performs the following actions:

1. Sets a simple key-value pair in local storage (`age: 24`).
2. Creates a user object (`username`, `age`, `city`).
3. Converts the user object into a JSON string using `JSON.stringify()` and saves it to local storage.
4. Logs the stored user object to the console.
5. Displays a simple “Hii” message on the web page.
