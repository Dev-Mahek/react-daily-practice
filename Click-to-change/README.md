# 🧠 Concept Overview

React’s `useState` hook allows you to:
- **Store values** that can change over time (state variables).
- **Update the UI automatically** when those values change.

In this example:
- The variable `click` stores the displayed name.
- The function `setclick()` updates that name when the button is pressed.
